# Contributing to ZCM

ZCM is an open-source project developed by its own users to solve daily problems. We have a few
guiding principles to our project, but we also try to be very open to new approaches. We love
contributions!

## Core Principles

  - Minimal dependencies: Crucial for supporting as many systems as possible
  - Code Mimicry: New code should match existing conventions
  - As Opt-In As Possible: Advanced dependencies and transports should be opt-in
  - Backwards Compatibility: Until v2.0 we aim for maximal compatibility with LCM

## Community

There are a few ways to join the community and stay informed on the latest ZCM news:

 - [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/ZeroCM/zcm)
 - [Github Project Page](https://github.com/ZeroCM/zcm)
 - [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zcm-users)
 - [Continuous Integration](http://ci.zcm-project.org)

## Pull Requests

We currently manage pull requests through GitHub, but it's often a good idea to
ping the mailing list or Gitter for feedback. Most of the core developers are very busy
career engineers whom may miss your contribution without a reminder or two.
